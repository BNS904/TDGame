# What am I building?
The goal of this program is to create a basic tower defense game. A tower defense game is a type of game in which enemies will start at one end of a map and try to make it to the other side of the map and if they do so, you will lose. To prevent this, you are given different “towers” that you can place to fend off the enemies and stop them from reaching the end.

# Why am I building a TD game?
I am building this specifically because of my love for video games. I tend to play a lot of video games in my free time, and I have always had an interest in designing a game of my own. This tower defense game not only serves as an academic project but also as a learning experience in the world of game development. 

# Plan and effort going forward
This program’s main goal is to provide entertainment and fun to the user. It will be used in that sense as well.
To make this game a reality there are a few various components that must be put in. The main 3 components would be the map, the enemies, and the towers themselves. This would be the bulk of the project as things like the enemy's movement and tower upgrades will need plenty of variables and methods to work properly. The time taken to do these main sections will be estimated at 2 weeks of work, including potential bugs that arise while coding the main game elements. Once the game’s features themselves are done, I would focus on assets for the menu, map, towers, and enemies to give a better visual element to the game overall. Alongside the asset, work will be the testing of the game and potential balancing to make the game fair. This would take roughly a week leaving some room for final game and program testing before its presentation.
